         BannerTator
         
A Simple Stupid Script to rotate images randomly.  This script was created originally to 
rotate banners on a forum site, but it can be used to rotate any images.  Everytime this
script is called, a different image is returned.

To use this script, place the bannertator.php file and the image directory in your webroot,
or where ever you hold your scripts.  Places the images you want rotated in the images dir.
Then in your HTML, call the script as you would an image.  That's it!  Here's a stupid example.

<img src="bannertator.php" />

Simple, I know.  Use it to your hearts content.  And if you would so oblige, can you folks link
my GitHub page with my other work?  Thanks.

By the way, "Simple Stupid Script" is a classification for scripts that are just that, simple
and stupid.
